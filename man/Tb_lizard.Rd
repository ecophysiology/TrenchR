\item{alpha_S}{is lizard solar absorptivity, alpha_S=0.9 (Gates 1980, Table 11.4)}

\item{alpha_L}{is lizard thermal absoptivity, alpha_L=0.965 (Bartlett & Gates 1967)}

\item{epsilon_s}{is surface emisivity of lizards, epsilon_s=0.965 (Bartlett & Gates 1967)}

\item{F_d}{is the view factor between the surface of the lizard and diffuse solar radiation (Bartlett & Gates 1967)}
