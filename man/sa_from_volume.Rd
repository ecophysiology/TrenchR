\usage{
sa_from_volume(V, taxa)
}

\description{
Calculate surface area from volume (Based on Mitchell 1976)
}
\details{
This function allows you to estimate surface area (m^2) from volume (m^3) for a variety of taxa by approximating animal shape as a sphere. The function is intended for use in estimating convection as in Mitchell (1976).
