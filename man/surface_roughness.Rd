\title{Estimate surface roughness from empirical measurements.}
\usage{
surface_roughness(u_r, zr)
}
\arguments{
\item{u_r}{is wind velocity at a vector of reference heights in m/s.}

\item{zr}{is the vector of reference heights in m.}
}
\value{
surface roughness (m)
}
\description{
This function allows you to estimate surface roughness in m from empirical wind speed (m/s) 
data collected at a vector of heights (m). Estimates surface roughness from empirical measurements.
