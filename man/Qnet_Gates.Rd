\title{Estimates net energy exchange between an animal and the environment in W.}
\usage{
Qnet_Gates(Qabs, Qemit, Qconv, Qcond, Qmet, Qevap)
}
\arguments{
\item{Qabs}{Solar and thermal radiation absorbed (W)}

\item{Qemit}{Thermal radiation emitted (W)}

\item{Qconv}{Energy exchange due to convection; Energy exchange from an animal to its surrounding environment (air or water) (W)}

\item{Qcond}{Energy exchange due to conduction; Energy exchange from animal to a surface if its in contact  (W)}

\item{Qmet}{Energy emitted due to metabolism (W)}

\item{Qevap}{Energy emitted due to evaporative water loss (W)}
}
\value{
net energy exchange (W)
