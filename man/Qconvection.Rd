\title{Calculate convection}
\usage{
Qconvection(T_a, T_b, H = 10.45, A, proportion, ef = 1.23)
}
\arguments{
\item{T_a}{Air Temperature in Kelvin.}

\item{T_b}{Initial Body Temperature in Kelvin.}

\item{H}{Convective heat transfer coefficient (W m^-2 K^-1)}

\item{A}{Surface area  in m^2}

\item{proportion}{of surface area exposed to air}

\item{ef}{is the enhancement factor, used to adjust H to field condictions.  Approximated as mean value of 1.23 by default, but see Mitchell 1976 for further information.}

\description{
Calculate convection
}
\details{
This function allows you to calculate convection from an organism to its environment as in Mitchell (1976). Includes an enhancement factor associated with outdoor environments. Reference: Mitchell. 1976. Heat transfer from spheres and other animal forms. Biophysical Journal 16(6): 561â€“569.
